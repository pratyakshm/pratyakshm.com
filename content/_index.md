## BACKGROUND

My name is Pratyaksh Mehrotra. I've been coding for 2+ years, into Android Platform twice that, and I'm a CS student since half that long. I'm currently in my sophomore year. I'm into film and music, and I'm a free thinker.

As of December 2022, I'm learning C++ as I'm about to enter the era of low-level programming. I've also planned to learn Rust, but I'm yet to break the ice on when I'll start learning it. I'm also a beginner into the field of cybersecurity and governance. I'm Microsoft certified on [Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals](https://www.credly.com/badges/784601b7-0eed-4f17-a87e-19077df232da). I've served as a Product Manager for the blazing fast and elegant (and now-defunct :/) RevengeOS aftermarket Android operating system / firmware. I led a small and diverse team of amazing and talented developer folks who handcrafted and shipped [RevengeOS version 4.1](https://t.me/RevengeOSNews/857) to dozens of Android devices for tens of thousands of Android modders around the world. Our website, [revengeos.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20220109120922/https://revengeos.com/) has been visited by well over 1 million people. I'm also Co-Founder of another Android related project called [FlameGApps](https://flamegapps.github.io). I've also maintained a project called [WinRice](https://github.com/pratyakshm/WinRice) that aims to ease setting up a brand new Windows device.

I would love it if you come and hang around on my [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/pratyakshm) channel, where I occasionally stream VALORANT and Euro Truck Simulator. That also gives away the fact that I'm into simulation and FPS gaming, though I don't like to call myself a gamer.

I've recently started blogging, primarily covering technology. You can read my blogs at [blog.pratyakshm.com](https://blog.pratyakshm.com/).
